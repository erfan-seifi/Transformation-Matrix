# Transformation-Matrix
This repository calculates the transformation matrix for 2D to 2D projection. In the following we want to explore the projection for a single point and generalize it to multiple points.

```math
$$\begin{bmatrix} 
| su |   |m11 m12 m13|
| sv | = |m21 m22 m23|
| s  |   |m31 m32 m33| 
\end{bmatrix}$$
```
