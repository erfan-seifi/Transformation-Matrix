# Transformation-Matrix
This repository calculates the transformation matrix for 2D to 2D projection. In the following we want to explore the projection for a single point and generalize it to multiple points.

$$ {\left\lbrack \matrix{2 & 3 \cr 4 & 5} \right\rbrack} 
* \left\lbrack \matrix{1 & 0 \cr 0 & 1} \right\rbrack
= \left\lbrack \matrix{2 & 3 \cr 4 & 5} \right\rbrack
$$
