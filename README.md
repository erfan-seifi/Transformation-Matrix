# Transformation-Matrix
This repository calculates the transformation matrix for 2D to 2D projection. In the following we want to explore the projection for a single point and generalize it to multiple points.

    [ a b c ]        [ 1 2 3 ]            [ a*1 b*2 c*3 ]
A = [ d e f ]    B = [ 4 5 6 ]    A * B = [ d*4 e*5 f*6 ]
    [ g h i ]        [ 7 8 9 ]            [ g*7 h*8 i*9 ]
